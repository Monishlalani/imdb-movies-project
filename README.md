Problem Statement
You are given a list that can contain positive and negative integers. You need to find two elements such that their sum is closest to zero.

 

For example, you are given a list [-4, 7, 6, 2, -5]. The two elements with the sum closest to zero will be -5 and 6.

 

Hints:

 

The sum can be either positive or negative, but the absolute distance of the sum from zero should be considered to find the sum closest to zero.
Assume that the maximum possible sum of any two elements in the list is 1000000000
Inbuilt sort may be helpful in this problem.
 

Input Format:

A list of integers

 

Output Format:

The output contains the two elements with the sum closest to zero.

 

 

Sample Test Cases:

Input:

[-4, 7, 6, 2, -5]

Output:

(-5, 6)

 

Input:

[-50, 34, -19, 24, 33, 10, -46, -38]

Output:

(-38, 34)
